# ED7039E - *Project in Industrial Computer Systems/Electronical Systems & Control Technology*
This repository will eventually constitute the full model,
any and all simulations related to, and implementation of the project for the D7039E and E7032E courses taken at Lule√• Technical University during the first semester of 2020-21.

The project is to model, simulate, and implement a robot that,
via communication over the [Arrowhead framework](https://www.arrowhead.eu/arrowheadframework),
automatically picks up a processed object at the end of a conveyor belt and moves it elsewhere.
The deadline for this project is December 1st, 2020.

Throughout the development of this project, the report under `report/` will continuously be updated.

## Building and project setup
The boot image of the Raspberry Pi 3 can be built via
```bash
$ # TODO: explain how to setup aarch64-linux emulation for cross-compilation
$ # TODO: explain how to write a local-secrets.nix
$ ./build.sh /dev/mmcblk0 # or your equivalent
```
