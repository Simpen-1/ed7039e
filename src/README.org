This directory serves as the source directory for the nodes that constitute our system.

* Entering a development environment
=shell.nix= contains an expression that automatically installs all required dependencies that the nodes require.
After installing Nix and executing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ nix-shell
#+END_SRC
you will be dropped into a development environment.
From here, you can readily execute the nodes in this directory.
