\subsection{Model}
The system is modelled in two parts: the moving base and the\ldots
% TODO: describe the moving base, and the attachment, whatever it ends up being.
% Include physical models.

\subsection{Simulation}
% Simulte the models from the previous section and show that it will work.
% Motivate regulation approach.

\subsection{Hardware}
% Explain the raspberry pi and it's attachments.

\subsection{Software}
