\section{Results}
\subsection{Performance of arm movement controllers}
Different controllers that was made for the motion control of the robot arm was compared when acting on a \(40^{\circ}\) angular error step response for vertical motion and \(60^{\circ}\) angular error step response for horizontal motion. In the following subsections graphs are presented where the evolution of the error is plotted against time for each controller. Rise time and settling time is shown for each test where rise time is the time measured at the error reaching \(5\%\) of the step value and settling time is measured at the error settling at \(2\%\) of the step value.
