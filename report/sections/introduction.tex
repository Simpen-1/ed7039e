\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
% Introduce ARTEMIS and the Arrowhead project
The ARTEMIS\footnote{\textbf{A}dvanced \textbf{R}esearch \& \textbf{T}echnology for \textbf{EM}bedded \textbf{I}ntelligent \textbf{S}ystems} Industry Association is an organisation with the goal of innovating the embedded intelligent systems sector in Europe.~\parencite{artemis}
One of the approaches to reach this goal was the 2013 start of the ARROWHEAD project which ``[address] the efficiency and flexibility at the global scale by means of collaborative automation for five application verticals; [one of which being] production (manufacturing, process, energy).''~\parencite{arrowhead-project-call}

% Summarize the result of the project
The project concluded 2017 and yielded the Arrowhead Framework which enable interoperability between Internet of Things (IoT) devices by providing guarantees for:
\begin{inline-enum}
    \item real-time data handling;
    \item data and system security;
    \item automation system engineering; and
    \item scalability of automation systems.
\end{inline-enum}
\parencite{arrowhead-project-about}
With the above guarantees provided by Arrowhead, resources otherwise required for developing a new framework (ad-hoc or not) may instead be allotted to the system the framework ultimately will interact with.

% Describe the reason for this project.
% TODO: extend/rewrite; describe that the process of moving an object from a to b by use of robots have not been solved yet (mentioned during the second lecture).
The reason for this project is then to verify that Arrowhead can indeed be used to resolve a common industry problem: production; specifically the act of moving a object from one station to another,
which is a common procedure in product pipelines.

% TODO: mention that Arrowhead aims to create de-facto standards for European industrialization efforts?

% XXX: Currently disjointed from the background section: background has large focus on Arrowhead. This section does not.
\subsection{Problem description}
% Summarize the problem and describe that we're simulating a factory settings.
The problem this project aims to solve is that of automatically moving an object from a designated pick-up point to a designated drop-off point on a system-external signal.
In practise, the problem space aims to mimic the environment of a factory floor where an object under manufacture has been fully processed in a station and should be moved to the next.

% Boil the issue down to simple mathematical terms.
Described in different terms, the problem is the automatic displacement of an object from a origin point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a destination point $(x, y, z)$,
where $(x, y)$ denote a position on the factory floor and $y, y \geq 0$, an elevation above the floor.

% Mention the inclusion of Arrowhead in the problem.
Additionally, a station signals a fully processed object via the Arrowhead Framework in a local cloud.
Upon this signal, the task of moving the object is to be delegated to the system this project aims to develop.

% TODO: insert an image of the conveyor belt with measures.

\subsection{Limitations}
% Note and expound on the very large problem domain.
The problem domain is vast and infinite configurations can mimic the wanted factory setting:
\begin{inline-enum}
    \item different placement/rotations of one or more stations;
    \item obstacles of multiple types; static and dynamic (e.g. humans, other robots);
    \item recovery/discard of a dropped object; and
    \item conditional and/or time-dependent origin/destination points.
\end{inline-enum}
Support for more configurations require a more complex system design, simulation and implementation;
and more complexity requires more development time.

The system developed in this project is to be thoroughly modelled, simulated, and implemented in the time span of twelve weeks (weeks 36--48).
For that reason (and those stated in the previous paragraph), this project is thus limited to one station:
a single designated pick-up point (elevated) and a single designated drop-off point (not elevated) --- both static.
Furthermore, the system environment will contain no other obstacles, and if an object is dropped, the displacement procedure ends and is considered to have failed.
