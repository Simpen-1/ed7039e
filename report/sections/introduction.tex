\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
% TODO: Mention the final goal of automating whole factories.
% Present Arrowhead and what its aims are.

\subsection{Problem description}
% Wait for an Arrowhead event, locate the object, pick it up, place elsewhere.
The problem this project aims to solve is that of automatically moving an object from a designated pick-up point to a designated drop-off point on a system-external signal.
In practise, the problem space aims to mimic the environment of a factory floor where an object under manufacture has been fully processed in a station and it to be moved to the next station.

Described in different terms, the problem is the automatic displacement of an object from a origin point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a destination point $(x, y, z)$,
where $(x, y)$ denote a position on the factory floor and $y, y \geq 0$, an elevation above the floor.

Additionally, the station signals a fully processed object via the Arrowhead Framework in a local cloud.
Upon this signal, the task of moving the object is to be delegated to the system this project aims to develop.

% TODO: insert an image of the conveyor belt with measures.

\subsection{Limitations}
The problem space is vast and infinite configurations can mimic a factory floor:
\begin{inline-enum}
    \item different placement/rotations of one or more stations
    \item obstacles of multiple kinds; static and dynamic (e.g. other robots)
    \item recovery/discard of a dropped object.
\end{inline-enum}
Support for more configurations require a more complex system.

For the above reason the project is thus limited to one or two stations,
an environment without any other obstacles and no recovery/discard of a dropped object.
If an object is dropped, the displacement procedure ends and is considered to have failed.
